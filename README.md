# Requirement
Matlab, Python3

# Repeating the result
1. Execute Event_detection_and_fft_extraction.m in Matlab. The key function of this code is detect the excitaitons from raw data, and extract FFT features for baselines.
2. Execute XXX. The key function of this code is utilize SVM for classificaiton from detected event samples.
